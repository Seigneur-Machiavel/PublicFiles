# Ecological objective

Solana's environmental impact are very low.\
But by using this beautiful ecosystem we want to make it neutral with a marge of positive carbon dioxide absorption.

We calculate CO2 emission for Solana node is lower than 2 ton of CO2 per years.\
One tree capte \~ 1 ton of CO2.

So KugleCorp target to doing donation to [https://trees.org/crypto/](https://trees.org/crypto/).

Our objective is 4 $ / node this year to be wide.

At this time : 971 nodes process the Solana's ecosystem.
