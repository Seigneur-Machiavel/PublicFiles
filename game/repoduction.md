# Reproduction

Reproduction process is a key of the game.

If one player have two matures Kugles, he can try create a new unique egg. _(Kugle are asexual.)_

**But take care, this processus is dangerous !** Parents have a chance to die.\
The only way to prevent this misfortune is to add [CO2](../fungibles-tokens/co2.md) to the combination process.

A popup will warn you of the risk percentage for your precious kugles. **But impossible to know which parent will be affected.**

Now you know why kugle is a particularly rare species.
